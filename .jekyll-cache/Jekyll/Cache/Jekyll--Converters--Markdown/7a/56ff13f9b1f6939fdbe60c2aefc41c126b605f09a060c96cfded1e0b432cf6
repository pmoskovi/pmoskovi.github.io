I"M<p>Watch live recorded footage of a bee family arriving to their newly selected home and move into a small beehive, a nuc box. We were lucky to catch the queen on camera, as well as how bees build a ladder or bridge to help their sisters climb into their new home. I used this image as the video thumbnail.</p>

<p>As part of the video, we rewind our clock about 3 weeks and review what happens shortly before the colony decides to swarm. I discuss the democratic debate that bees hold to decide where their next home is going to be.</p>

<p>If you’re here to see the queen in the swarm, jump to minute 6:00.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in watching the bees use their own bodies to construct a bridge, fast forward to minute 8:00 in the video.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a bee farm? What was it like?</p>
