I"C<p>Watch live recorded footage of a bee family arriving to their newly selected home and move into a small beehive, a nuc box. We were lucky to catch the queen on camera, as well as how bees build a ladder or bridge to help their sisters climb into their new home. I used this image as the video thumbnail below.</p>

<p>I added some commentary to the video. We rewind our clock about 3 weeks and review what happens shortly before the colony decides to swarm. I talk about the democratic debate that bees hold to decide where their next home is going to be. If you want to learn more about this miracle, check out Thomas Seeley’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Honeybee-Democracy-Thomas-D-Seeley/dp/0691147213">Honeybee Democracy </a>.</p>

<p>If you’re here to see the <b>queen</b> in the swarm, jump to <b>minute 6:00</b>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in watching the <b>bees use their own bodies to construct a bridge</b>, fast forward to <b>minute 8:00</b> in the video.</p>
