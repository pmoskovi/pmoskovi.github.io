I"Î<p>In this video you get to see live footage of a bee family arriving to their newly selected home and move into a small beehive, a nuc box. In this video youâ€™ll get to see the queen, as well as how bees build a ladder or bridge to help their sisters climb into their new home.</p>

<p>As part of the video, we rewind our clock about 3 weeks and review what happens shortly before the colony decides to swarm. I discuss the democratic debate that bees hold to decide where their next home is going to be.</p>
