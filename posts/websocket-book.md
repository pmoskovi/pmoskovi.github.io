author: Peter Moskovits

excerpt: This is my book about WebSocket. The book provides an introduction to WebSocket, then describes the WebSocket API and Protocol and provides hands-on examples. We deep dive into three use cases for WebSocket, all using higher-level standard protocols (text and binary) over WebSocket. We walk through building a grown-up version of a chat application using XMPP/WS, a rock-paper-scissors game using pub-sub and STOMP/WS, and desktop sharing using RFB/WS (VNC). Finally, we examine security and deployment considerations.

The book provides an introduction to WebSocket, then describes the WebSocket API and Protocol and provides hands-on examples. We deep dive into three use cases for WebSocket, all using higher-level standard protocols (text and binary) over WebSocket. We walk through building a grown-up version of a chat application using XMPP/WS, a rock-paper-scissors game using pub-sub and STOMP/WS, and desktop sharing using RFB/WS (VNC). Finally, we examine security and deployment considerations.

## Source Code and Preconfigured VM

The book comes with the source code you need to get the demos up and running, as well as an easy-to-use VM with screencasts that show you what you’ll build. Check out the following screencasts for a quick view into the VM environment and what the hands-on that the chapters cover. You can also dive right into the code yourself:
